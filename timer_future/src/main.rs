/// Task executor that receives tasks off of a channel and runs them.
/// In Rust, Receiver<Arc<Task>> is a type that represents a receiver for a multi-producer, single-consumer (MPSC) channel that sends Arc<Task> instances.
/// The Receiver type is part of Rust's standard library and is used to receive messages sent over channels. The Arc type is an atomically reference counted smart pointer, 
/// which is used to allow multiple ownership of a value across threads. Finally, Task is a type that represents a unit of work that can be executed asynchronously.
/// When combined, Receiver<Arc<Task>> represents a way to receive Task instances that have been sent over a channel and wrapped in an Arc to allow for shared ownership between multiple threads. 
/// This can be useful in scenarios where multiple threads need to work on a set of tasks concurrently, and the results of those tasks need to be sent back to a single thread for further processing.
